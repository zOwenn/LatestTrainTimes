# LatestTrainTimes

**Description**
Just a simple app to show the latest train times at Sheffield Station as a Technical Test for a job application.

**Implementation**
_Just a quick note, when starting on this project - I had planned to do a simple side project to get more accomodated with the Kotlin language, however this quickly grew into an implementation of the Technical Test app. I took this chance to make a pass over code to clean it up for submission to a git repo, rather than drop the entire project files at once._

_Comment on implementation choices here, think about this more once code has been committed_
